# Project Overview
Face recognition is one of the most popular computer vision tasks with a wide range of applications. This project demonstrates the following:

Detection of faces from images or live webcam feed.
Recognition of individuals based on pre-trained models.
The project leverages state-of-the-art libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow to achieve accurate and efficient results.

# Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
